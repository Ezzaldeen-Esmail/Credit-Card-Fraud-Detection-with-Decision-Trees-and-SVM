    "\n",
    "## **1. Introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**  \n",
    "Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a powerful **supervised learning** algorithm used for **classification** and **regression** tasks. They work by finding the optimal **decision boundary (hyperplane)** that best separates different classes in the dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Key Characteristics of SVMs**  \n",
    "- **Maximizes Margin**: SVMs aim to find the hyperplane that maximizes the distance (margin) between the closest points of different classes.  \n",
    "- **Works in High-Dimensional Spaces**: Effective even when the number of features exceeds the number of samples.  \n",
    "- **Kernel Trick**: Can handle non-linear decision boundaries by transforming data into higher dimensions.  \n",
    "- **Robust to Overfitting**: Particularly effective when the number of features is large compared to the number of observations.  \n",

    "## **2. How SVMs Work**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.1 Linear SVM (Hard Margin SVM)**  \n",
    "- **Objective**: Find the hyperplane that perfectly separates two classes with the maximum margin.  \n",
    "- **Mathematical Formulation**:  \n",
    "  - Given training data \\( (x_i, y_i) \\), where \\( y_i \\in \\{-1, 1\\} \\), SVM finds \\( w \\) (weight vector) and \\( b \\) (bias) such that:  \n",
    "    \\[\n",
    "    y_i (w \\cdot x_i + b) \\geq 1 \\quad \\forall i\n",
    "    \\]\n",
    "  - The margin width is \\( \\frac{2}{\\|w\\|} \\), so maximizing the margin is equivalent to minimizing \\( \\|w\\| \\).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.2 Soft Margin SVM (Handling Non-Separable Data)**  \n",
    "- **Problem**: Real-world data is often noisy and not perfectly separable.  \n",
    "- **Solution**: Introduce a **slack variable** \\( \\xi_i \\) to allow some misclassifications.  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Minimize} \\quad \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 + C \\sum_{i=1}^n \\xi_i\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  \\text{Subject to} \\quad y_i (w \\cdot x_i + b) \\geq 1 - \\xi_i \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\xi_i \\geq 0\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  - **C (Regularization Parameter)**:  \n",
    "    - **Small C**: Wider margin, more misclassifications allowed (softer margin).  \n",
    "    - **Large C**: Narrower margin, fewer misclassifications (harder margin).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2.3 Non-Linear SVM (Kernel Trick)**  \n",
    "- **Problem**: Some datasets are not linearly separable.  \n",
    "- **Solution**: Map data to a higher-dimensional space where separation is possible.  \n",

    "| **RBF (Gaussian)** | \\( K(x_i, x_j) = \\exp(-\\gamma \\|x_i - x_j\\|^2) \\) | Complex non-linear boundaries |\n",

    "- **Epsilon (ε)-Insensitive Tube**: Predictions within \\( \\pm \\epsilon \\) of the true value are not penalized.  \n",
    "- **Objective**: Minimize the deviation outside the ε-tube while keeping the model as flat as possible.  \n",
    "  \\[\n",
